    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- INTEGER: basic class of numbers, positive/0/negative\n",
    "- TEXT: strings, anything represented by a string of characters not being used for direct calculation\n",
    "- REAL: real numbers - integers, but with decimal points. Up to 15 digits long.\n",
    "- BLOB: basically anything outside of these - images, complex data chunks, things we don't want to touch or directly analyze in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Primary Keys are the unique identifiers of the entries in a table. Foreign Keys are any column in that table used to pair up with a Primary Key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example might be: a Students table with id numbers (primary key) for each student. Their 'homeroom_teacher_id' column can be a foreign key to the Teachers table's 'teacher_id', which is its Primary Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "3 types:\n",
    "- One-to-one: Direct relationship of one entry to exactly one other entry in another table.\n",
    "- One-to-many: Relationship of a larger-scale table ('offices') to a smaller-scale table with lots of entries for each entry in the other table ('employees')\n",
    "- Many-to-many: Complex relationship between lots of entries ('employees') and lots of entries in another table ('customers'), where many customers are associated with many employees in multiple ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "- Thinking of it as a Venn diagram, joins are differentiated by which tables and what intersections are included in the query.\n",
    "- JOIN / LEFT JOIN: All the 'left' table entries, with any 'right' table entries that match.\n",
    "- RIGHT JOIN: The reverse of LEFT joins\n",
    "- INNER JOIN: All entries existing in both tables, but none that are exclusive to either\n",
    "- OUTER JOIN: All entries that match only one table, but none that match both\n",
    "- FULL JOIN: rarely used, matches every entry in the left and every in the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Aggregate functions (COUNT/SUM/MAX/MIN/AVG/etc) require GROUP BY statements to function. By choosing a column to aggregate, the function then has a nice bundle of entries to operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "These allow many-to-many JOINs to exist! These are interstitial tables/queries that are formed to elucidate the sometimes complex and picky relationship between entries in many-to-many joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
